			<p>How good were Manchester City in their derby win over Manchester United? How far are City ahead of United? And where do United need to improve? Gary Neville gives his verdict... City were largely comfortable as they beat United 3-1 at the Etihad on Sunday, with David Silva, Sergio Aguero and Ilkay Gundogan scoring the goals for the hosts.</p>
			<p>"Manchester City are 12 points clear of Manchester United with 12 games gone in the season. It's sobering really. You could argue this is a far better Manchester City team but United should be a lot closer, they are under-achieving in terms of how they have started the season.

			"For City, the demands that were placed on them by pundits at the end of last season were could they go and win back-to-back titles and repeat the great performances? They are a third of the way through the season and they are delivering.
			</p>
			<p>"Obviously, Manchester United's ultimate goal has to be to win a Premier League trophy but to win a title you need to look at the whole team; they can't keep a clean sheet, their midfield can't pass the ball forward and their front three don't have the precision and ruthlessness of Liverpool or City. So they aren't going to win titles because in every part of the pitch they are behind the team's going for a title."
